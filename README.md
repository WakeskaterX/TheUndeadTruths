#About

This project is a bit of an experiment.  I took part in NaNoWriMo a while back and wrote a story that I quite enjoy, but I am no expert author, I'm just a web & game developer.

So, this is going to be an open source book, laying out my revision of my first draft into individual chapters and files as I rewrite the story, for anyone to see and criticize or make suggestions.

My only request is that you be kind, I don't write often, so I am no expert on story telling.

So feel free to create issue, pull requests if you have typo fixes, and follow me along as I slowly rewrite this novel.
