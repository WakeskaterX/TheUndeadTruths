###The Dark Diary - Entry 4

**Nov 5, 2025**

Yesterday I met with the master for the first time face to face.  Up close he is a relatively handsome man: mid-thirties looking, yet with salt-and-pepper gray dotting his temples, accenting his otherwise jet black hair.  His eyes are the color of dried blood, deep and dark red, with flecks of orange in them.  I have never seen anything like it.  Many Immortals have yellow or even orange eyes, but I have never seen anyone with such dark red eyes.  From what I have been able to gather the longer an Immortal lives and the more he feeds on human substance the yellower his eyes get, until they start darkening.  The Master, however, is unique in his eye color, lending credence to the theory of him being our origin.

When it was my turn to be addressed, I was simply summoned by his oppressive will.  He didn’t have to say anything and yet I knew it was time for me to walk up to him.  I simply felt his will, and obeyed.  Standing before him was awe inducing and inspiring.

"Child," he said to me, his voice deep and thick like an ocean storm.  "Your success is admirable.  I have noticed your wit and your impressive talent."  His smile then was like a blessing from heaven.  I was suddenly filled with a powerful bliss.  I nearly fell to my knees in reverence.  "You are being promoted to a squad leader, child.  You will command ten of the lesser Immortals and I expect great things from your squad.  Is this satisfactory my child?"

"Yes,"  I replied, my voice dry and rough from disuse.  "One..." I hesitated, mustering up the courage to speak, "One request master."  I bowed my head down low.  "May Bucket join my team?"  The master looked at me with his head cocked slightly and then gave a short nod, and waved me away to talk to the next one in line.

I walked back to my self-claimed spot in the camp and sat down near where Bucket was laying on the ground.  I kicked him and he sat up.  When I told him about my promotion he jumped up with what I imagine was a smile.  He is missing his lower lip so it was more of a frightening grimace than anything else.

"Yad, Gaa, Jaa"  He replied emphatically.  When I told him he was going to be in my squad he leapt in the air and began running around in circles dancing and grunting.  He’s a strange fellow sometimes, but a cheerful one.

As he danced around a servant of the master approached with a bloody sack.  The bag contained human entrails and the servant explained that squad leaders were provided daily meals to keep us in shape to lead the troops.  I was fairly hungry.  The Hunger hadn’t taken hold of me yet, but I gladly ate to avoid it.  I shared a bit of the food with Bucket and we sat down to enjoy our meal.

We rested and began moving our camp in the morning.  All of today was spent traveling and setting up camp again.  We travel often to avoid staying in one place for too long.  Many times we travel in places humans don’t frequent such as sewage systems, icy mountain passes and dangerous cliffs and valleys.  Our enhanced strength allows us to travel in places that humans wouldn’t normally think to traverse.  We can scale difficult cliffs with ease and travel across wide plains quickly.  Generally, we travel in forests and underground during the day and wait until night to cross wide plains.

Our master has begun reworking the camp as well.  Perhaps he saw the disorganization as I did and made some changes.  Our camp was set up today in three separate sections.  First is the Army, which is the bulk of our forces.  This section is still mostly disorganized and Immortals sleep wherever they feel like and they stand around aimlessly and get into meaningless brawls.  Occasionally an Immortal will kill another and tear him apart when the Hunger gets too strong but one of the responsibilities of Squad Leaders is to stifle insurrection and kill the offender.  I told Bucket to not get killed for doing something stupid.

The second section is the Armory.  Some of the more intelligent Immortals are recruited to make and enhance weapons to arm the squads.  Workers in the armory are tasked with cleaning and repairing weapons and finding suitable Immortals to wield them.  They are also responsible for training newly armed Immortals with their new weaponry.  It’s an attractive part of the camp for some, as they are rewarded only slightly less than squad leaders with ‘meals’.  To me it seems far too menial and tedious, but perhaps there are some redeeming qualities as the Armory doesn’t go out on every raid.

The last section consists of the Servants: those Immortals that tend to the administrative and logistical needs of the Army.  They carry out the orders of the Master, making sure that the Armory workers, squad leaders and legion commanders are fed and relay orders to the squads and legions of the Master’s commands.  They are camped closest to the Master and follow him with unwavering obedience.

Tomorrow I will meet with my squad.  Although traditionally we do not have names, I have thought about it and being able to identify and distinguish between my soldiers would be beneficial.  Also, new names will take their thoughts off the fact they used to be humans.  If they can forget that a little, perhaps it will be easier for them.  I will remember and carry that burden for them.

Having fresh entrails daily to consume is both a blessing and a curse.  My writing should remain more consistent as my mind will stay alert, and perhaps that will hold my sanity.  It is all I have left.  But I do not relish in having to kill with a fresh mind, the Hunger makes it so much easier.  I won’t have to be in the fray as much, as a squad leader, though.  No, now I get to command others to kill mercilessly for me.  What an improvement.

I have some ideas in how to improve our combat effectiveness and will test them out with my new squad.  It’s terrible but something in us drives us to survive, to succeed.  Despite the terrible sins we commit each time, we push on.  So I will make my squad effective, we will survive and kill for now.  I will bear these sins of ours at least for Bucket’s sake.  He is like an innocent child, one that can tear a human in half with very little effort.  It’s morbid to think about, but he’s a good friend in these dark times.  So tomorrow I will meet my squad and we will become ruthless killing machines.  We will hone our skills and kill all we come across.  We will practice in our downtime and strategize.

The poor humans will fear us, God help their souls.
