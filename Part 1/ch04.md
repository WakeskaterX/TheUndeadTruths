They come!  Ha, the Master knows!  He KNOWS.  His plan is ready, His plan to kill them all!  Foolish fleshlings don’t see the obvious trap.  They are stupid, idiots, oblivious to the destruction the Master will rain down upon their petty heads.  They come to hunt the hunters.  What foolishness.

The Master, the Master, He trusts me—He sees my strength.  He gave me a blade, a fine blade for cutting open bellies of flesh.  Our snipers are ready, our warriors strong.  The craving pulses within us.  We will feast on the supple entrails of the fleshlings.  Oh tender sweet juicy flesh, I NEED IT.  The fleshling fools think we cannot use their weapons, that we are stupid.  They are the dumb ones!  Their idiocy is their end.

Tonight I will feast and be filled.  My mouth waters at the thought of tender morsels of flesh crushed beneath my teeth, the soul-water flowing down my face.  Oh the joy, the bliss, the power to be gained!

We shall kill them all: every last one, every enemy, every weakling.  We are power incarnate.  We are wisdom descended from the sky.  We are creation risen from the earth.  We are immortals and the fleshlings will fear us as they have never felt fear before!  We are the rightful rulers of this pitiful planet!
