###Introduction

This work of literature is a compilation of articles, journals and diaries from a dark time in our history.  I have taken the liberty of compiling these documents into a chronological account of the events that occurred during this veiled time to reveal the truth about what happened during those forgotten days.

This compilation centers primarily around one particularly interesting account, a journal of one of those reviled beings.  This 'Dark Diary' provides insight into the plague that beset our lands and the creatures that invaded.  This source along with the journals of a few other key figures tells the sad story of bravery, valor, evil and hatred.  May the men who lost their lives never be forgotton.
